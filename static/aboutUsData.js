    `Eric Stallings is a professional comedian - turned software engineer specializing in JavaScript (ES6+) and completely fascinated by Graph Databases. He hails from Chicago, where he toured with the famous Second City comedy theater by day and solved Leet Code challenges at night. He'll tell you a joke if you submit that pull request. Follow him on all the social medias: @EricStallings`,
    `Neftali grew up outside of Chicago but calls Los Angeles her home, despite the heat. Her unorthodox educational journey began as a physics major at a math, science, engineering school where she got her B.S. in history. She enjoys thinking and learning about math and computer science education, reading non-fiction, and being helpful. Her favorite technologies include Express/Node.js, PostgresQL and graph databases. She dreams of one day working at Mozilla.`,
    `Tanner is from Dallas, Texas and currently live in Chicago. Tanner also lived in Ukraine for a couple years and considers it his second home. He is a big fan of NYC and would like to live there someday. When he is not coding, Tanner enjoys watersports, running, and reading. Some of his favorite books are: Principles by Ray Dalio, Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card, and Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.`,
    `Taylor is originally from Little Rock, Arkansas--which he still considers as home. Before Los Angeles (where Taylor lives now), he was living in New Orleans, Louisiana, which is still his favorite city in the world. Previously Taylor repaired and rebuilt coffee equipment (i.e. espresso machines, coffee brewers, etc.). Before that, Taylor was in school for three years studying theology.`
